# Mock Restaurant Page
A brewery page created using JavaScript and Webpack.
It is a real brewery that I pulled inspiration, text, and images from for this proof of knowledge / personal learning project.

The purpose of this project was to use and learn webpack. Using dynamic DOM manipulation with JavaScript alone to generate entire website contents.
