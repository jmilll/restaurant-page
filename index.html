            <h2>The Taproom at Urbanrest</h2>
            <p>Our spacious taproom at Urbanrest has a limited capacity, and operates on a first-come, first-served basis. We believe its the only fair way to do things.
            </p>
            <p>Our space is designed to bring the consumer in to the brewing process while also providing a comfortable atmosphere to spend time with friends, engage in conversation and enjoy the fruits of our brewing labor.
            </p>
            <p>We offer house-made charcuterie boards with meat and cheese from local producers. We have food trucks/pop-ups six days per week as well! You can order outside, bring your food in and sit down & enjoy a beer. Easy.
            </p>
            <p>We serve in 5oz sample, 12oz and 16oz sizes at various price ranges. Growler fills are also available to go.
            </p>
            <p>We tried our best to create an efficient filling process to make picking up a Growler of our beer as quick and painless as possible. First, check the board for today’s fill options. If you don’t have a bottle, both 750ml and 2L sizes are available for purchase. We also fill 32oz and 64oz growlers from any other brewery for the price of the 750ml and 2L.
            </p>
            <p>If you’d like a small sample of something before you buy, we are happy to accommodate.
            </p>
            <p>Our growlers are filled to order to maintain freshness. A blanket of CO2 purges out unwanted oxygen from the container ensuring a quality fill and giving us the peace of mind that you’ve received a beer that won’t break down quickly. Please keep your growler cold, drink it fresh and do not age. Growlers are a perishable product.</p>
